Voice-based biomarkers can help diagnose symptoms of dementia such as 
Parkinson's disease, PD is a modern neurodegenerative disease affecting about 7 
million people worldwide (usually adults), with about 150 thousand new 
scientific diagnoses performed each year. Historically, PD has been difficult to 
find and documents tend to focus on a few symptoms and even ignore some, 
depending on the scores of independent points. Due to the decline in motor 
manipulation which is a sign of illness, the term can be used as a means of 
detecting and diagnosing PD. Common sense has meant that physicians often 
focus on the symptoms of PD while ignoring the other. By using independent 
measurement scales, the term can be used to diagnose and diagnose the disease. 
This paper presents evidence to support the concept of supervised classification, 
which can be used to diagnose individuals with diseases such as diabetes and 
pulmonary fibrosis. Through Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision 
Trees, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor. The project 
also uses various Evaluation Methods and Metrics such as Classification Report, 
F1 - Score, Accuracy, Precision, Recall.
